# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-07)

**Core value:** Conductor orchestration and cross-session coordination must work reliably in production
**Current focus:** Defining requirements for v1.2

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: --
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-03-07 -- Milestone v1.2 started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v1.0]: 3 phases (skills reorg, testing, stabilization), all completed
- [v1.0]: TestMain files in all test packages force AGENTDECK_PROFILE=_test
- [v1.0]: Shell sessions during tmux startup window show StatusStarting from tmux layer
- [v1.0]: Runtime tests verify file readability (os.ReadFile) at materialized paths
- [v1.1]: Architecture first approach for test framework
- [v1.1]: No new dependencies needed; existing Go stdlib + testify + errgroup sufficient
- [v1.1]: Integration tests use real tmux but simple commands (echo, sleep, cat), not real AI tools
- [v1.1-04-01]: Used dashes in inttest- prefix to survive tmux sanitizeName
- [v1.1-04-01]: TestingT interface for polling helpers enables mock-based timeout testing
- [v1.1-04-01]: Fixtures use statedb.StateDB directly (decoupled from session.Storage)
- [v1.1-04-02]: Fork tests use manual ParentSessionID linkage (CreateForkedInstance is Claude-specific)
- [v1.1-04-02]: Shell-only restart tested (dead session recreated via Restart fallback path)
- [v1.1-05-01]: Shell sessions map tmux "waiting" to StatusIdle (not StatusRunning) in UpdateStatus
- [v1.1-05-01]: Separate test functions per tool for debuggability over table-driven super-tests
- [v1.1-05-02]: cat command as child process for send tests (reads stdin, echoes stdout)
- [v1.1-05-02]: 300ms fsnotify startup delay accounts for debounce + registration time
- [v1.1-05-02]: Unique instance IDs with UnixNano() prevent test collisions
- [v1.1-05-02]: t.Cleanup for event file removal prevents orphaned artifacts
- [Phase 06]: Multi-line chunked payload avoids terminal line buffer overflow (canonical mode ~4096 byte limit)
- [Phase 06]: Sentinel message after chunked send proves sequential delivery without scrollback capture
- [v1.1-06-02]: Replicated setupSkillTestEnv pattern in integration package (unexported helper cannot cross package boundary)
- [v1.1-06-02]: 12 concurrent sessions with errgroup for race detection stress testing
- [v1.1-06-02]: Dual StateDB instances on same file simulates cross-process StorageWatcher behavior
